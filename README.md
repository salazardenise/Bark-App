**Note to instructors**: Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted my Angular App (ui folder) associated with this project. It was due to my limited understanding of git submodules. While I thought that, when I git-added the top-level directory, the ui folder was also added. That was not the case. In trying to fix the issue, I ended up deleting and could not recover it back. I am attaching a screenshot of the front-end that I had taken Sunday morning as a visual reference.
